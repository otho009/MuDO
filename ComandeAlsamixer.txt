Alsamixer : pour des r√©glages hardware

Run it without parameters to get an overview about your devices.

amixer

Then use the set command to set the volumn. For example to set the master channel to 50%:

amixer set Master 50%
Note the "%" sign, without it it will treat the value as 0 - 65536 level.

To mute :

amixer -D pulse sset Master mute

To unmute:

amixer -D pulse sset Master unmute

To turn volume up 5%:

amixer -D pulse sset Master 5%+

To turn volume down 5%:

amixer -D pulse sset Master 5%-

if the user has muted the device you have to 'unmute' it. otherwise setting the percentage will work but the sound is still off

amixer set 'Master' 100% unmute
/usr/bin/amixer set 'PCM' 100% unmute
